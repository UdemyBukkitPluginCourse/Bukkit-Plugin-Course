# How to contribute 
Members of the community are welcome to share their code that are functional copies of what Stephen showcased in his videos. You can do so by cloning this project on your computer and then submitting a pull request.

If you use Intellij you can do File > New > Project From Version Control and copy and paste the link to the repository. After that you can commit any changes and I'll review them before pushing them to the repository.

Contact dec4234 on the discord server if you have questions
